Code for paper "Federated Intelligent Terminals Facilitate Stuttering Monitoring"
## Abstract
Stuttering is a complicated language disorder. The most common form of stuttering is developmental stuttering, which begins in childhood. Early monitoring and intervention are essential for the treatment of children with stuttering. Automatic speech recognition technology has shown its great potential for non-fluent disorder identification, whereas the previous work has not considered the privacy of users' data. To this end, we propose federated intelligent terminals for automatic monitoring of stuttering speech. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated intelligent terminals model can analyze symptoms of stammering speech in different contexts. Furthermore, the federated learning model facilitates personalized treatment while considering individual privacy.
## Main contributions below:

 * We build the horizontal FL framework SecureBoost and construct two federated participants. It is verified that the performance of the FL model is not significantly degraded compared to data-centralised training.
 * XGBoost has flexible portability and precise library. It facilitates FL based on XGBoost to optimize algorithm with minimal resources, which makes it easier to be used in FITs. 
 * FITs could be used for portable monitoring of stuttering. Most importantly, FITs store data locally without collecting the data centrally, which effectively protect personal information.
